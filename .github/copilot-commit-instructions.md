## Implementation Examples

### Feature Implementation

\```
feat(auth): implement OAuth2 authorization code flow

Implement RFC-6749 compliant OAuth2 authorization code flow
with PKCE extension for enhanced security. Add support for
multiple identity providers with provider-specific configuration.

Key implementations:
- Token exchange endpoint with JWK validation
- PKCE challenge/verifier implementation
- Refresh token rotation with absolute timeouts
- State parameter validation for CSRF prevention

Resolves: #123
Documentation: docs/oauth2-integration.md
\```

### Bug Fix Implementation

\```
fix(core): resolve race condition in connection pool

Fix thread synchronization issue in connection acquisition that
could lead to database connections being returned to the pool
while still in use. Implement proper happens-before relationship
with atomic operations instead of mutex lock.

The race condition would manifest when connection pool reached
75%+ capacity under high concurrency (>100 req/sec), resulting
in occasional "connection reset" errors.

Performance impact: +2% latency, -15% connection errors

Fixes: #456
Related: #442, #447
\```

### Refactoring Implementation

\```
refactor(api): migrate endpoint handlers to async traits

Replace function-based request handlers with trait-based
implementation using async_trait. This enables more flexible
composition and better testability through dependency injection.

Key improvements:
- Explicit interface boundaries through trait definitions
- Uniform error handling across all endpoints
- Better testability with mock implementations
- Clearer separation of concerns with handler responsibilities

Modified files:
- src/api/handlers/*.rs
- src/api/routes.rs
- src/api/middleware.rs
\```
